### Also, use the following command to create a new "Type"
### CREATE TYPE LengthFilterType AS ENUM ('Long', 'Medium', 'Short');

### 2 [0.25]. Write a single query/statement to set the values of the new columns.

### Long: length(text) > 100, Medium: length(text) between 50 and 100,
###         and Low: length(text) < 50
### Use CASE to write this part.
### You may have to do an explicit cast for the popularity attribute using '::lengthfiltertype'

### 4 [0.25]. Use "generate_series" to write a single statement to insert 10 new tuples

### 5 [0.25]. The above command should not have actually worked, because the "ID" column is
### a primary key, and we are trying to insert duplicate values.
###
### However, because of the way we created the table, the "ID" column is not actually a primary key.
### In fact, none of the constraints from the original "Comments" table were copied over.
###
### You can see this by running: "\d commentscopy" in psql, and looking at the "CONSTRAINT" section
### and also "Nullable" column (and comparing to "\d comments").
###
### Write a single ALTER TABLE command to add a NOT NULL constraint on the "ID" column, add
### a foreign key constraint on the "PostId" column, and add a check constraint on the "Score" column (score >= 0).
###
### Link to documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html

### We can't add a primary key constraint any more, because there are duplicate values in the "ID" column now
### and those would need to be taken care of manually first.

### 7 [0.25]. Write a statement to create a new View with the signature:

###
### We have created a table using WITH for you:

### Our goal is to create a new table with columns: 
###      (ID, Title, CreatedYear, CreatedMonth, Score, AvgScoreForPostsFromThatMonth)
### Here: AvgScoreForPostsFromThatMonth is basically the average score of posts across
### that are created in that month
###
### This kind of an output table will allow us to compare each post with the other posts
### which are created in that same month
### Order by: CreatedYear first, CreatedMonth next, and then ID;
###
### Note: We will be checking that you are using window functions.
###
### First few rows would look like this:

### 9 [0.25]. Write a function that takes in the ID of a Post as input, and returns the

### So calling NumVotes(20) should return 67. Make sure your function returns 0
### appropriately (for Posts who do not have any Votes).
### 
### Confirm that the query below works after the function is created:
###             select ID, Title, NumVotes(ID) from Posts limit 100

### 10 [0.5]. Write a function that takes in an Userid as input, and returns a JSON string with

###  { "userid": 7,
###    "displayname": "Toby",

###    ]}
###
### The posts should be ordered by "date" first, and then by title of the post.

### You should use PL/pgSQL for this purpose -- writing this purely in SQL is somewhat cumbersome.
### i.e., your function should have LANGUAGE plpgsql at the end.

### Function signature: UserPosts(in integer, out PostsJSON varchar)
###
### HINT: Use "string_agg" aggregate functions for creating the list of badges properly: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-aggregate-functions/postgresql-string_agg-function/
### Use "FORMAT()" function for constructing the JSON strings -- you can also
### use CONCAT, but FORMAT is more readable: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-string.html#FUNCTIONS-STRING-FORMAT

### BE CAREFUL WITH WHITE SPACES -- we will remove any spaces before comparing answers, but there is

###             group by u.id
###             having count(b.ID) > 10;
###
### Create a new trigger that: 
###         When a tuple is inserted or deleted or updated in the Badges relation, appropriately
### modifies StarUsers.
###         Specifically:
###             For inserts, if the UserId for the new Badges tuple is already present in StarUsers,
###                  then the NumBadges should be increased by 1.
###             If the UserId for the new Badges tuple is NOT present in StarUsers,
###                 then it should check whether the addition of the new Badge makes the User
###                 a StarUser, and add the entry to StarUsers table if so.
###             In case of a delete, the NumBadges should be decreased, and if it goes below 11,
###                 the entry should be removed from StarUsers.
###             In case of an update, the NumBadges should be updated accordingly, and entries
###                 should be added or removed from StarUsers as necessary.
